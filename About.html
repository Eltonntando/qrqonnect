   <h3>You may have already noticed some strange-looking square boxes in magazines and commercials. QR Codes, or Quick Response Codes, are two-dimensional matrix barcodes.</h3>
<br><br>
QR Codes are comparable to the regular bar codes that may be seen on a variety of consumer products, with the exception that QR codes may include a lot more data than typical barcodes. QR codes have been widely used in Japan and Europe in recent years, but marketers in the everywhere in the world are only now beginning to adopt them.
<br><br>
A QR code can be thought of as a paper-based linkage that connects the physical and internet worlds. QR codes allow advertisers to connect people to mobile landing pages with far more information and interactivity than can be found on a printed page. They can be found on adverts, pamphlets, posters, and even clothes or billboards. Any marketing or outreach campaign gains a new dimension of communication with this merging of print and web via mobile.

<br><br>
What Are QR Codes and How Do They Work?
<br><br>
A QR Code is read by scanning it using a mobile device equipped with a camera and a QR Code reader application. These apps are available for free download on popular smartphone platforms including iPhone and Android.
<br><br>
When a QR Code is scanned using the device's camera, it is converted into usable data, such as a text message or a mobile web page.
<br><br>
What Are the Benefits of QR Codes in Marketing?
<br><br>
QR codes can be used in a variety of ways for marketing and promotions in a range of situations. QR codes can be embedded in a wide range of printed items, including:
<br><br>
• Displays for Conferences and Events
<br><br>
• Advertisements in Print
<br><br>
• Postcards and Mailers • Business Cards • Brochures, Posters, and Flyers
<br><br>
What Is a QR Code and What Can It Do?
<br><br>
After scanning a QR code, the encoded data can be utilized to automatically activate a variety of events on the user's device, including:
<br><br>
• View a Mobile Website or Landing Page
<br><br>
• Call a Phone Number
<br><br>
• Text a Friend
<br><br>
• Email a Friend
<br><br>
• View a Message or Special Offer
<br><br>
• Download Contact Information (VCARD)
<br><br>
• View a Google Maps Location
<br><br>
• Take a look at a social media profile
<br><br>
What Kinds of Businesses Can Use QR Codes?
<br><br>
QR Codes can be used in marketing materials by almost any organization. If a section of your target audience uses smartphones, a QR Code can be a terrific way to identify yourself and reach people in new ways, whether you're a retail shop, a charitable organization, a membership group, or an educational institution.
<br><br>
What Are Some Examples of QR Code Applications?
<br><br>
QR Codes can be used in a variety of ways to strategically connect offline and online media. Here are a couple such examples:
<br><br>
• A consultant's business card includes a QR code that directs visitors to a landing page with glowing client testimonials or a VCard that allows them to download contact information.
<br><br>
• A QR code on a public education poster about substance misuse leads to a mobile website that includes a self-assessment questionnaire and community support options.
<br><br>
• A QR code with a link to their Google Places page with customer ratings and coupons is shown by a local company.
<br><br>
• To see product demonstrations and evaluations, a retail store displays a QR Code next to in-store merchandise.
<br><br>
• A QR code on a nonprofit organization's marketing links to a volunteer and donation page.
<br><br>
• On a takeout menu, a restaurant incorporates a QR code that leads to a mobile restaurant website with online reservations, orders, and interactive directions.
<br><br>
• A link to a how-to video with installation instructions is included with a home-repair product.
<br><br>
• A political candidate's campaign sign includes a QR code that leads to an audio file with a message from the candidate or a mobile landing page with the politician's bio, campaign platform, and volunteer and contribution options.
<br><br>
• At a conference, a vendor sets a QR code on their display booth so that guests may quickly scan and store the vendor's information.
<br><br>
• In front of a residential property, the seller inserts a QR Code on the For Sale sign, which provides further home details, interior images, and a Google Maps position for further reference.
<br><br>
• A QR Code on a movie poster offers a link to a trailer video and a form to sign up for notifications when the film is released.
<br><br>
What Are Some of the Other Benefits of QR Codes?
<br><br>
• User Convenience — QR Codes make sending consumers to a website, phone number, instructions, promotions, or other information a simple one-step process.
<br><br>
• Eco-Friendly — QR Codes can help you make better use of printed goods and cut down on waste.
<br><br>
• Economical – QR Codes are free to create, and their use is only limited by your marketing approach.
<br><br>
• Versatile - QR Codes can be used with a wide range of marketing materials, including print collateral, outdoor displays, and direct mail, for almost any purpose.
<br><br>
• Device Independent - Unlike apps, QR codes and the landing pages they link to are viewable on all popular smartphone models and do not require unique programming for different platforms (e.g. iPhone vs. Android).
<br><br>
• Measurable - Web analytics or other marketing campaign measurement tools can be used to track actions generated by QR Codes.
<br><br>
• Competitive Differentiation - Because QR Codes are still relatively new, those who are among the first to deploy them in outreach programs will distinguish themselves as strategic marketing leaders.
<br><br>
Key Points to Keep in Mind When Using QR Codes in Marketing Campaigns
<br><br>
There are a few crucial aspects to keep in mind when using QR codes strategically in communications:
<br><br>
• Context and Content - the QR code should link the user to relevant content that complements the printed item where the code is found. Simply pointing a QR code at the homepage of your website is unlikely to result in action.
<br><br>
• Instruction/Call to Action - Unless you're in Japan, your target users are likely to need a hint to convince them to scan the QR code. It might also be beneficial to include some details on what users might expect to see after scanning the code (e.g. "scan this code for a special offer...").
<br><br>
• Mobile Landing Page - The individual who scans the code is almost certainly using a handheld device. As a result, for the best user experience, make sure users are directed to a mobile-friendly landing page. Sending consumers to a website designed for desktop viewing is both ineffective and unprofessional.
<br><br>
• Tracking and reporting - If you're going to utilize QR codes in marketing campaigns, you'll need to be able to measure the number of scans over time, as well as collect geographic data and other data. You may do this more successfully with the help of a QR code tracking and reporting system.
